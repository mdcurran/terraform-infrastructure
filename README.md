# terraform-infrastructure

This repository details the configuration of the infrastructure I've deployed for
personal projects on different cloud providers.

This includes:

* Terraform state files stored remotely on GCS.
* A [static website](https://mdcurran.com) deployed with S3 and CloudFront.
* A three node Kubernetes cluster provisioned with [k3s](https://k3s.io)
  deployed on DigitalOcean.
